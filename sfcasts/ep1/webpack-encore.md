# Hello Webpack Encore

Our CSS and JavaScript setup is fine: we have a `public/` directory with
`app.css` and `question_show.js`. Inside our templates - like `base.html.twig` -
we include the files with traditional link or script tags. Sure, we use this
`{{ asset() }}` function, but it doesn't do anything important. Symfony isn't
touching our frontend assets at all.

That's fine. But if you want to get serious about frontend development - like
using a frontend framework like React or Vue - you need to take this up to the
next level.

To do that, we're going to use a Node library called Webpack: which is the
industry-standard tool for managing your frontend assets. It combines
and minifies your CSS and JavaScript files... though that's just the tip of the
iceberg of what it can do.

But... to get Webpack to work *really* well requires a lot of complex config.
So, in the Symfony world, we use a *wonderful* library called Webpack Encore.
It's a lightweight layer on *top* of Webpack that... makes it easier! And we
have an entire [free tutorial](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/webpack-encore)
about it here on SymfonyCasts.

But let's go through a crash course right now.

## Installing Webpack Encore

First, make sure you have node installed:

```terminal-silent
node -v
```

And also yarn:

```terminal-silent
yarn -v
```

***TIP
If you don't have Node or Yarn installed - see official manuals about how
to install it for _your_ OS. For Node, see https://nodejs.org/en/download/
and for Yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install . We recommend
using Yarn version 1.x to follow this tutorial.
***

Yarn is one of the package managers for Node... basically Composer for Node.

Before we install Encore, make sure you've committed all your changes - I already
have. Then run:

```terminal
composer require "encore:^1.8"
```

Wait... a minute ago, I said that Encore is a *Node* library. So why are we
installing it via Composer? Great question! This command does *not* actually
install Encore. Nope, it installs a very small bundle called
`webpack-encore-bundle`, which helps our Symfony app *integrate* with
Webpack Encore. The *real* beauty is that this bundle has a *very* useful recipe.
Check it out, run:

```terminal
git status
```

Woh! Its recipe did a *lot* for us! One cool thing is that it modified our
`.gitignore` file. Go open it in your editor. 

[[[ code('28c0dcbd53') ]]]

Cool! We're now ignoring `node_modules/` - which is Node's version of the 
`vendor/` directory - and a few other paths.

The recipe also added some YAML files, which help set things up - but you don't
really need to look at them.

The *most* important thing the recipe did was give us these 2 files: `package.json` -
which is the `composer.json` of Node - and `webpack.config.js`, which is the Webpack
Encore configuration file.

Check out the `package.json` file. This tells Node which libraries it should
download and it already has the basic stuff we need. Most importantly:
`@symfony/webpack-encore`.

## Installing Node Dependencies with yarn

To tell Node to install these dependencies, run:

```terminal
yarn install
```

This command reads `package.json` and downloads a *ton* of files and directories into
a new `node_modules/` directory. It might take a few minutes to download everything
and build a couple of packages.

When it's done, you'll see two new things. First, you have a fancy new
`node_modules/` directory with *tons* of stuff in it. And this is already being
ignored from git. Second, it created a `yarn.lock` file, which has the same function
as `composer.lock`. So... you should commit the `yarn.lock` file, but not
worry about it otherwise.

Ok, Encore is installed! Next, let's refactor our frontend setup to use it.
