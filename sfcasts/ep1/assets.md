# Assets: CSS, Images, etc

We're doing really well, but yikes! Our site is *ugly*. Time to fix that.

If you download the course code from this page, after you unzip it, you'll find
a `start/` directory with a `tutorial/` directory inside: the same `tutorial/`
directory you see here. We're going to copy a few files from it over the next
few minutes.

## Copying the Base Layout & Main CSS File

The first is `base.html.twig`. I'll open it up, copy its contents, close it,
and then open *our* `templates/base.html.twig`. Paste the new stuff here.

[[[ code('21a000cf1e') ]]]

This was *not* a huge change: this added some CSS files - including Bootstrap -
and some basic HTML markup. But we have the same blocks as before:
`{% block body %}` in the middle, `{% block javascripts %}`,
`{% block title %}`, etc.

Notice that the link tags are *inside* a block called `stylesheets`. But that's
not important yet. I'll explain why it's done that way a bit later.

[[[ code('13ee9de667') ]]]

One of the link tags is pointing to `/css/app.css`. That's *another* file that
lives in this `tutorial/` directory. In fact, select the `images/` directory *and*
`app.css` and copy both. Now, select the `public/` folder and paste. Add another
`css/` directory and move `app.css` inside.

Remember: the `public/` directory is our document root. So if you need a file to
be accessible by a user's browser, it needs to live here. The path `/css/app.css`
will load this `public/css/app.css` file.

Let's see what this looks like! Spin over to your browser and refresh. *Much*
better. The middle still looks terrible... but that's because we haven't added
any markup to the template for this page.

## Does Symfony Care about your Assets

So let me ask a question... and answer it: what features does Symfony
offer when it comes to CSS and JavaScript? The answer is... none... or a lot!

Symfony has two different levels of integration with CSS and JavaScript. Right
now, we're using the basic level. Really, right now, Symfony isn't doing *anything*
for us: we created a CSS file, then added a very traditional link tag to it in HTML.
Symfony is doing *nothing*: it's all up to you.

The *other*, *bigger* level of integration is to use something called Webpack
Encore: a *fantastic* library that handles minification, Sass support, React or
Vue.js support and many other things. I'll give you a crash course into Webpack
Encore at the end of this tutorial.

But right now, we're going to keep it simple: you create CSS or JavaScript files,
put them in the `public/` directory, and then create `link` or `script` tags that
point to them.

## The Not-So-Important asset() Function

Well, actually, even with this, "basic" integration, there is *one* small Symfony
feature you should use.

Before I show you, go into your PhpStorm preference... and search again for
"Symfony" to find the Symfony plugin. See this web directory option? Change that
to `public/` - this was called `web/` in older versions of Symfony. This will give
us better auto-completion soon. Hit "Ok".

Here's the deal: whenever you reference a static file on your site - like a CSS
file, JavaScript file or image, instead of just putting `/css/app.css`, you should
use a Twig function called `asset()`. So, `{{ asset() }}` and then the *same* path
as before, but without the opening `/`: `css/app.css`.

[[[ code('e90509371d') ]]]

What does this super-cool-looking `asset()` function do? Almost... nothing. In
fact, this will output the *exact* same path as before: `/css/app.css`.

So why are we bothering to use a function that does nothing? Well, it *does*
do *two* things... which you may or may not care about. First, if you decide to
deploy your app to a *subdirectory* of a domain - like
`ILikeMagic.com/cauldron_overflow`, the `asset()` function will automatically
prefix all the paths with `/cauldron_overflow`. *Super* great... if you care.

The *second* thing it does is more useful: if you decide to deploy your assets
to a CDN, by adding one line to one config file, suddenly, Symfony will prefix
*every* path with the URL to your CDN.

So... it's really not *that* important, but if you use `asset()` everywhere, you'll
be happy later when you need it.

But... if we move over and refresh... surprise! It explodes!

> Did you forget to run `composer require symfony/asset`? Unknown function `asset`.

How cool is that? Remember, Symfony starts small: you install things *when* you
need them. In this case, we're trying to use a feature that's not installed... so
Symfony gives us the *exact* command we need to run. Copy it, move over and go:

```terminal
composer require symfony/asset
```

When this finishes... move back over and... it works. If you look at the HTML
source and search for `app.css`... yep! It's printing the same path as before.

## Making the "show" page Pretty

Let's make the middle of our page look a bit nicer. Back in the `tutorial/`
directory, open `show.html.twig`, copy its contents, close it, then open up our
version: `templates/question/show.html.twig`. Paste the new code.

[[[ code('7807b55f2a') ]]]

Once again, there's nothing important happening here: we're still overriding the
same `title` and `body` blocks. We're still using the same `question` variable
and we're still looping over the `answers` down here. There's just a lot of extra
markup... which... ya know... makes things pretty.

When we refresh... see! Pretty! Back in the template, notice that this page
has a few `img` tags... but these are *not* using the `asset()` function. Let's
fix that. I'll use a shortcut! I can just type "tisha", hit tab and... boom!
It takes care of the rest. Search for `img`... and replace this one too with
"tisha". Wondering who tisha is? Oh, just one of the several cats we keep on staff
here at SymfonyCasts. This one manages Vladimir.

[[[ code('c3b798bd91') ]]]

By the way, in a real app, instead of these images being static files in our
project, that might be files that users *upload*. Don't worry: we have an
entire tutorial on
[handling file uploads](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony-uploads).

Make sure this works and... it does.

## Styling the Homepage

The *last* page that we haven't styled is the homepage... which right now...
prints some text. Open its controller: `src/Controller/QuestionController.php`.
Yep! It's just `return new Response()` and text. We can do better. Replace this
with `return $this->render()`. Let's call the template `question/homepage.html.twig`.
And... right now... I don't think we need to pass any variables into the template...
so I'll leave the second argument off.

[[[ code('597721a2c8') ]]]

Inside `templates/question/`, create the new file: `homepage.html.twig`.

Most templates start the *exact* same way. Yay consistency! On top,
`{% extends 'base.html.twig' %}`, `{% block body %}` and `{% endblock %}`. In
between, add some markup so we can see if this is working.

[[[ code('34a7e7af54') ]]]

Ok... refresh the page and... excellent! Except for the "this looks totally
awful" part.

Let's steal some code from the `tutorial/` directory *one* last time. Open
`homepage.html.twig`. This is *just* a bunch of hardcoded markup to make things
look nicer. Copy it, close that file... and then paste it over our
`homepage.html.twig` code.

[[[ code('5a7ba368ed') ]]]

And now... it looks *much* better.

So that's the *basic* CSS and JavaScript integration inside of Symfony: you manage
it yourself. Sure, you *should* use this `asset()` function, but it's not doing
anything too impressive.

If you want more, you're in luck! In the *last* chapter, we'll take our assets
up to the next level. You're going to love it.

Next: our site now has some links on it! And they all go nowhere! Let's learn how
to generate URLs to routes.
