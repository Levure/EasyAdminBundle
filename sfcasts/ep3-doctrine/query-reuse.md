# Reusing Query Logic & Param Converters

Maybe my favorite thing about the `QueryBuilder` is that if you have multiple methods
inside a repository, you can *reuse* query logic between them. For example, a lot
of queries might need this `andWhere('q.askedAt IS NOT NULL')` logic. That's *not*
complex, but I would still *love* to not repeat this line over and over
again in every method and query. Instead, let's centralize this logic.

## Private Method to Mutate a QueryBuilder

Create a new private function at the bottom. Let's call it `addIsAskedQueryBuilder()`
with a `QueryBuilder` argument - the one from ORM. Make this also *return*
a `QueryBuilder`.

[[[ code('b6332ca605') ]]]

Inside, we're going to *modify* the `QueryBuilder` that's passed to us to *add*
the custom logic. So, `$qb->` and then copy the
`andWhere('q.askedAt IS NOT NULL')`. Oh, and `return` this.

[[[ code('c54974236f') ]]]

Pretty much every `QueryBuilder` method returns *itself*, which is nice because
it allows us to do method chaining. By returning the `QueryBuilder` from *our*
method, we will *also* be able to chain off of it.

Ok, back in the original method, *first* create a `QueryBuilder` and set it to a
variable. So, `$qb = $this->createQueryBuilder()`.

[[[ code('fb5066df30') ]]]

Then we can say `return $this->addIsAskedQueryBuilder($qb)` and then the rest of
the query.

[[[ code('59d00e3ad0') ]]]

How cool is that? We now have a private method that we can call whenever we
have a query that should *only* return published questions. And as a bonus... when
we refresh... it doesn't break!

## Making the QueryBuilder Argument Option

But it *is* kind of a bummer that we needed to *first* create this empty
`QueryBuilder`. It broke our cool-looking method chaining. Let's see if we can
improve this.

Create another private method at the bottom called `getOrCreateQueryBuilder()`.
This will accept an *optional* `QueryBuilder` argument - so
`QueryBuilder $qb = null`. And, it will *return* a `QueryBuilder`.

[[[ code('485c2731d0') ]]]

This is *totally* a convenience method. If the `QueryBuilder` is passed, return
it, else, return `$this->createQueryBuilder()` using the same `q` alias.

[[[ code('853a60d38d') ]]]

This is useful because, in `addIsAskedQueryBuilder()`, we can add `= null` to make
*its* `QueryBuilder` argument optional. Make this work by saying
`return $this->getOrCreateQueryBuilder()` passing `$qb`. Then
`->andWhere('q.askedAt IS NOT NULL')`

[[[ code('7acd77ad67') ]]]

So, if somebody passes us an existing `QueryBuilder`, we use it! But if not,
we'll create an empty `QueryBuilder` automatically. That's customer service!

All of this basically just makes the helper method easier to use above. Now we
can just `return $this->addIsAskedQueryBuilder()` with *no* `$qb` argument.

Before we celebrate and throw a well-deserved taco party, let's make sure it
works. Refresh and... it does! Sweet! Tacos!

Next, I've got another shortcut to show you! This time it's about letting Symfony
query for an object automatically in the controller... a feature I *love*.
