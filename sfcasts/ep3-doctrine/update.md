# Update Query & Rich vs Anemic Models

On the show page, we can now up vote or down vote the question... mostly. In
the controller, we read the `direction` POST parameter to know which button was
clicked and change the vote count. This doesn't save to the database yet, but
we'll do that in a few minutes.

## Adding upVote and downVote Methods

Before we do, we have another opportunity to improve our code. The logic inside the
controller to increase or decrease the vote isn't complex, but it *could* be simpler
and more descriptive.

In `Question`, at the bottom, add a new `public function` called `upVote()`. I'm
going make this return `self`. 

[[[ code('a3b3f08486') ]]]

Inside, say `$this->votes++`. Then, `return $this`... just because that allows method
chaining. All of the setter methods return `$this`.

[[[ code('0a7876f243') ]]]

Copy this, paste, and create another called `downVote()` that will do `$this->votes--`.

[[[ code('3c6ed75ed2') ]]]

I'm not going to bother adding any PHP documentation above these, because... their
names are already so descriptive: `upVote()` and `downVote()`!

I love doing this because it makes the code in our controller *so* nice. If
the direction is `up`, `$question->upVote()`. If it's `down`, `$question->downVote()`.

[[[ code('241ddf187d') ]]]

How beautiful is that? And when we move over to try it... we're still good!

## Rich vs Anemic Models

We've now added *three* custom methods to `Question`: `upVote()`, `downVote()`
and `getVotesString()`. And this touches on a somewhat controversial topic related
to entities. Notice that every property in our entity has a getter and setter method.
This makes the entity super flexible: you can get or set any field you want.

But sometimes you might not need - or even *want* - a getter or setter method. For
example, do we really want a `setVotes()` method? Should anything in our app be
able to set the vote directly to *any* number? Probably not. Probably we will
always want to use `upVote()` or `downVote()`.

Now, I *will* keep this method... but only because we're using it in
`QuestionController`. In the `new()` method... we're using it to set the fake data.

But this touches on a really interesting idea: by removing any unnecessary getter or
setter methods in your entity and *replacing* them with more descriptive methods
that fit your business logic - like `upVote()` and `downVote()` - you can, little
by little, give your entities more clarity. `upVote()`, and `downVote()` are *very*
clear & descriptive. Someone calling these doesn't even need to know or care
how they work internally.

Some people take this to an extreme and have almost *zero* getter and setter
methods on their entities. Here at Symfonycasts, we tend to be more pragmatic.
We usually have getters and setters method, but we always look for ways to be
more descriptive - like `upVote()` and `downVote()`.

## Updating an Entity in the Database

Okay, let's finish this! In our controller, back down in `questionVote()`, how
can we execute an *update* query to save the new vote count to the database? Well,
no surprise, whenever we need to *save* something in Doctrine, we need the
entity manager.

Add another argument: `EntityManagerInterface $entityManager`. 

[[[ code('f841f59cf6') ]]]

Then, below, replace the `dd($question)` with `$entityManager->flush()`.

[[[ code('a5f0d6c0ba') ]]]

Done! Seriously! Doctrine is smart enough to *realize* that the `Question` object
already exists in the database and make an *update* query instead of an insert.
*We* don't need to worry about "is this an insert or an update" at all? Doctrine
has that covered.

## No persist() on Update?

But wait, didn't I forget the `persist()` call? Up in the `new()` action, we
learned that to insert something, we need to get the entity manager and then call
`persist()` *and* `flush()`.

This time, we *could* have added `persist()`, but we don't need to. Scroll back
up to `new()`. Remember: the point of `persist()` is to make Doctrine *aware* of
your object so that when you call `flush()`, it knows to *check* that object and
execute whatever query it needs to save that into the database, whether that
is an INSERT of UPDATE query.

Down in `questionVote()`, because Doctrine was used to *query* for this `Question`
object... it's *already* aware of it! When we call `flush()`, it already knows
to check the `Question` object for changes and performs an UPDATE query.
Doctrine is smart.

## Redirecting

Ok, now that this is saving... what should our controller return? Well, usually
after a form submit, we will redirect somewhere. Let's do that. How?
`return $this->redirectToRoute()` and then pass the name of the route that we
want to redirect to. Let's use `app_question_show` to redirect to the show page
and then pass any wildcard values as the second argument: `slug` set to
`$question->getSlug()`.

[[[ code('82e8655912') ]]]

Two things about this. First, until now, we've *only* generated URLs from inside
of Twig, by using the `{{ path() }}` function. We pass the same arguments to
`redirectToRoute()` because, internally, it generates a URL just like `path()`
does.

And second... more of a question. On a high level... what *is* a redirect? When
a server wants to redirect you to another page, how does it do that?

A redirect is *nothing* more than a special type of *response*. It's a response
that has a 301 or 302 status code and a `Location` header that tells your browser
where to go.

Let's do some digging and find out how `redirectToRoute()` does this. Hold
Command or Ctrl and click `redirectToRoute()` to jump to that method inside of
`AbstractController`. This apparently calls another method: `redirect()`. Hold
Command or Ctrl again to jump to that.

Ah, *here's* the answer: this returns a `RedirectResponse` object. Hold Command
or Ctrl *one* more time to jump into this class.

`RedirectResponse` live deep in the core of Symfony and it *extends* `Response`!
Yes this is just a special subclass of `Response` that's really good at creating
*redirect* responses.

Let's close all of these core classes. The point is: the `redirectToRoute()`
method doesn't do anything magical: it simply returns a `Response` object that's
really good at redirecting.

Ok: testing time! Spin over to your browser and go back to the show page. Right
now this has 10 votes. Hit "up vote" and... 11! Do it again: 12! Then... 13!
Downvote... 12. We got it!

Like I said earlier, in a real app, when we have user authentication, we might
prevent someone from voting multiple times. But, we can worry about that later.

Next: we *have* created a way to load dummy data into our database via the
`/questions/new` page. But... it's pretty hacky.

Let's replace this with a proper *fixtures* system.
